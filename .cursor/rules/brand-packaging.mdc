# Brand Packaging

## Core Principle

There is ONE Zura. Operators grow into its full capability. You are not selling tiers -- you are selling progression into deeper infrastructure.

## NEVER Name Tiers

- Zura Lite
- Zura Pro
- Zura Premium
- Basic / Pro / Premium
- Any consumer SaaS tier language

Those are software tiers. Zura is infrastructure. Tiers must feel architectural, not consumer.

## Tier Structure

### Tier 1: Operator (Single Location)
**For:** Founder-led brands building infrastructure early.
**Includes:** Core POS+CRM, centralized performance dashboard, commission automation, foundational AI insight.
**Positioning:** "Build infrastructure before you expand."

### Tier 2: Growth (2-5 Locations)
**For:** Scaling brands standardizing execution.
**Includes:** Multi-location dashboards, cross-location analytics, margin intelligence, advanced AI alerts, role-based permissions.
**Positioning:** "Scale systems. Not chaos."

### Tier 3: Infrastructure (5+ Locations)
**For:** Established regional brands.
**Includes:** Executive command dashboards, AI strategic forecasting, KPI architecture customization, standardization enforcement, enterprise analytics.
**Positioning:** "Infrastructure for real organizations."

### Tier 4: Enterprise (Custom)
**For:** Chains, PE-backed brands, institutional scale.
**Includes:** Regional benchmarking, advanced forecasting, data warehousing, custom AI modeling, dedicated support.
**Positioning:** "Intelligence infrastructure at scale."

## Pricing Scales With

- Location count
- User count
- Operational complexity
- Intelligence depth

## How It Feels

- Single location: "We run our business on Zura."
- Five locations: "We run all locations on Zura."
- Enterprise: "Our infrastructure is Zura."
- Same name. Different depth.

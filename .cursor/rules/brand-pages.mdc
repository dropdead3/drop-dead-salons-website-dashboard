# Brand Pages Architecture

## Homepage Sections (in order)

### 1. Hero
Minimal. Architectural. Calm. White space.
- Headline: "Zura"
- Subline: "Infrastructure for Leaders Building the Next Generation of Beauty Brands."
- Support: "We build intelligence infrastructure for scaling operators."
- Primary CTA: "Request Access"
- Secondary CTA: "See How Zura Works"
- No feature list. No clutter.

### 2. Industry Truth
- "The beauty industry mastered artistry. It did not master infrastructure."
- Most brands scale revenue before they scale systems.

### 3. Define Chaos
Headline: "Operational chaos doesn't start where you think it does."
- Founder-dependent decisions
- Fragmented tools
- Spreadsheet visibility
- Inconsistent standards
- Manual KPI tracking
- Reactive management
- Closing: "These are symptoms. The root is infrastructure."

### 4. The Solution
- "One structured operational framework."
- "Zura unifies intelligence, operations, and execution into one system."
- Bullets: Centralized command, standardized architecture, AI-assisted leadership, multi-location control, real-time intelligence.

### 5. Segment by Psychological State
Four panels:
- Overwhelmed Operator: "Working nonstop. Still behind."
- Plateaued Founder: "Revenue stable. Growth stalled."
- Scaling Operator: "Growing fast. Getting messy."
- Strategic Leader: "You need structured intelligence."

### 6. Three Pillars Visual
Intelligence | Infrastructure | AI-Assisted Leadership

### 7. Social Proof / Case Studies

### 8. Final CTA
"Request Access"

## About Page Structure

1. Industry problem statement
2. What Zura does (replaces improvisation with architecture)
3. Why infrastructure matters
4. Built by industry insiders (credibility)
5. Future of beauty brands
6. Closing CTA

## Navigation Architecture

Consider segmentation:
- Single Location
- Multi-Location
- Enterprise

Each page adapts emphasis without changing core identity. Zura remains infrastructure.

## Move Service Mix from Capacity Utilization to Forecasting Card (By Category Mode) — COMPLETED

Service Mix donut and legend removed from both `CapacityUtilizationCard.tsx` and `CapacityUtilizationSection.tsx`. A new `ServiceMixLegend` component was created and added to both `ForecastingCard.tsx` and `WeekAheadForecast.tsx`, appearing below the bar chart when "By Category" mode is toggled on.
